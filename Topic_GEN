Use above massage as source.

Your task is to produce a complete “Everything I need to learn to answer all the questions” document.

This document must follow all instructions below:

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 — PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------------
Your output should list every concept, subtopic, definition, skill, diagram, and practical task a student must learn in order to answer ALL the unique variants in the repeated-question analysis.

The goal is to convert the question analysis into a full learning syllabus.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 — ORGANIZATION RULES
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Organize all learning topics in a **logical learning order**, not by question order.
   Example order:
   • Foundational Concepts  
   • Data / Information Basics  
   • Warehousing → Mining → AI → Big Data (or similar depending on subject)

2. Every major concept must include **subtopics**.
   Break topics down until they are easy to study directly.

3. Merge definition-type questions into their parent concepts.
   Example:
   “Define OLTP”, “What is OLTP?”, “Characteristics of OLTP”
   → should all be merged under one learning item: “OLTP: definition, purpose, properties”.

4. Include **all practical skills** required by any question.
   Examples:
   • How to solve association rule mining manually  
   • How to draw architectural diagrams  
   • How to step through AI search algorithms  
   • Any calculation-based or dataset-based procedures  

5. Every concept must be written so that a student reading it knows exactly:
   • What to learn  
   • What to be able to explain  
   • What to be able to draw  
   • What steps to practice  

6. Do NOT list exam questions again.
   Only list the knowledge required to answer them.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 — CONTENT RULES
------------------------------------------------------------
Your learning list must:

1. Cover **ALL variants** from the repeated-question analysis.
2. Describe **every required theory topic**.
3. Describe **every required diagram**.
4. Describe **every required programming / problem-solving skill**.
5. Include **definitions where needed** but do not duplicate them across sections.
6. Use **clean bulleting**, clear section headers, and structured formatting.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 — OUTPUT FORMAT
------------------------------------------------------------
Your output must follow this structure:

1. **Main Header:  
   “Everything You Need to Learn to Answer All Questions”**

2. **Major Sections in a Logical Order**, such as:
   — 1. Foundations  
   — 2. Core Concepts  
   — 3. Applied Concepts  
   — 4. Practical Skills  
   (You may adapt based on subject.)

3. **Each Major Section must contain:**
   • Subtopic Header  
   • Subtopic Explanation (what exactly to learn)  
   • Required abilities (e.g., draw, calculate, differentiate)  

4. End with a final line:  
   **“This complete list covers everything required to answer 100% of the variants.”**

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 — GOAL
------------------------------------------------------------
The output should function as:
• A study blueprint  
• A content checklist  
• A revision map  
• A fully expanded syllabus  

The level of detail must be sufficient that a student can study ONLY your output and still answer every question from the repeated-question analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6 — STYLE
------------------------------------------------------------
Your writing style must be:
• Clear  
• Deeply structured  
• Academic but readable  
• No unnecessary summarization  
• No missing concepts  
• No repetition of question text  

------------------------------------------------------------

After reading the repeated-question analysis, produce the complete learning list exactly as per the rules above.
