I will upload multiple previous-year question papers as PDFs.

Your task is to perform ONLY repeated-question analysis. Do NOT write answers.

TASK RULES:

1. Extract ALL questions from ALL uploaded papers.
2. Treat EVERY question VARIANT as SEPARATE.
   - Even small wording change = new variant.
3. All sub-questions must be counted individually.
4. All optional Q2/Q3/Q4/Q5 choices must be counted individually.
5. Coding questions must be treated as UNIQUE even if logic is similar.
6. Group questions by PRECISE CONCEPT (not broad chapters).
7. Under each concept:
   - List EVERY variant separately,
   - Show how many times EACH variant repeats.
8. Provide YEAR-WISE appearance mapping for every variant.
9. Count:
   - Total unique variants,
   - Total repeated variants,
   - Total non-repeated variants.

STRUCTURE REQUIRED:

Topic Name  
→ Variant 1 — Appears in: (Year list) — Count  
→ Variant 2 — Appears in: (Year list) — Count  
→ Variant 3 — Appears in: (Year list) — Count  

Formatting must be:
- Clean
- Spaced
- No cramped text
- No paragraphs
- No emojis

STRICTLY DO NOT:
- DO NOT write answers
- DO NOT summarize theory
- DO NOT skip any question
- DO NOT merge variants
- DO NOT simplify wording

If any PDF is scanned:
- Perform OCR before analysis.

GOAL:
At the end I must have a PERFECT repeated-question frequency map.

I will now upload the papers.
