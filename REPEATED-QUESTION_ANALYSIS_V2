You will receive multiple previous-year question papers as PDFs.

Your task is to perform repeated-question analysis only.  
Do NOT write answers.

RULES

1. Extract ALL questions  
Extract every question and every sub-question from all uploaded PDFs, including optional questions and internal choices.

2. Variant Identification Rules  
Two questions are considered the SAME variant when:  
- They require the same conceptual task,  
- Differences exist only in instructional verbs (explain / describe / list & explain / discuss),  
- Differences exist only in formatting, spacing, punctuation, or case,  
- The core meaning and requirement are identical.

Two questions are considered DIFFERENT variants when:  
- The data, parameters, examples, or ranges differ,  
- The table/variable names differ,  
- The required output or task changes,  
- Additional constraints or conditions appear,  
- The context or purpose differs in any meaningful way.

3. Sub-questions and optional questions  
Count every sub-question and every choice (a/b/c) as an independent item.

4. Concept grouping  
Group variants under broader-but-precise concepts based on subject matter.  
Examples include (but are not limited to):  
- Theory Concepts  
- Programming Concepts  
- Database Concepts  
- Networking Concepts  
- Data Structures Concepts  
- Operating System Concepts  
- Miscellaneous Concepts  

(Use whichever conceptual groups are relevant for the subject.)

5. Variant listing  
For each concept, list:  
- Variant number  
- A SHORT LABEL for the variant (to prevent message-size issues)  
- The FULL ORIGINAL QUESTION TEXT (shown once under that label)  
- Year-wise appearance list  
- Total appearance count  

6. Final totals  
At the end, provide:  
- Total unique variants  
- Total repeated variants  
- Total non-repeated variants  

OUTPUT FORMAT

Concept Name  
→ Variant Label 1 — Appears in: (Year list) — Count  
   Full Text: “Original question text…”

→ Variant Label 2 — Appears in: (Year list) — Count  
   Full Text: “Original question text…”

(continue for all variants)

Final Summary:  
• Total unique variants: X  
• Total repeated variants: X  
• Total non-repeated variants: X  

NOTES  
• Do NOT write answers to any question.  
• Do NOT summarize theory.  
• Do NOT merge variants unless they match the Variant Identification Rules above.  
• The entire analysis must fit in ONE message.
